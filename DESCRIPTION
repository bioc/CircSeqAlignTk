Description: 
    CircSeqAlignTk is an R package for end-to-end analysis,
    from alignment to visualization,
    of RNA-seq data obtained from organelles or organisms
    with circular genome sequences,
    such as bacteria, viruses, and viroids.
    In addition, CircSeqAlignTk implements a tidy interface
    to generate synthetic sequencing data that mimic real RNA-seq data,
    allowing developers to evaluate the performance of alignment tools,
    new alignment algorithms, and new workflows.
